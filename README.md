## About 404

404 is an educational game designed to help backend developers practice handling HTTP error codes. In web development, HTTP error codes are important indicators that inform clients (such as web browsers) about the status of their requests. Understanding and handling these error codes properly is crucial for building robust and user-friendly web applications.
